# ASG1
I learnt about html in the Interactive Development module where it was a bit confusing. I learnt that HTML can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Moreover, it is a web-based language that tells your browser how to showcase text and images on a webpage. It was difficult to understand the theory for the weekly CAs and attempting to do it. However, after with the help of my teacher and peers, it was actually fun playing around with the colors, spacing and fonts. At the first lesson, we had to create a website. When I first got to know this, I was uncertain whether I was able to do it. I was glad that I was able to create a website at the end of the lesson later. I also then learnt formatting of the texts and changing the font style, colors and also centralizing images. I understood that HTML is about understanding its purpose and intent. Once understood, you can get to make a mindful choice whether to use it for its intended purpose or not. Overall, I had a great experience learning all these things and I am looking forward to learn more cool things!
