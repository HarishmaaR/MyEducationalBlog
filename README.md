##I learnt about html in the Interactive Development module where it was difficult to understand first. However, after with the help of my teacher and peers, it was actually fun playing around with the colors, spacing and fonts. At the first lesson, we had to create a website. When I first got to know this, I was uncertain whether I was able to do it. I was glad that I was able to create a website at the end of the lesson later. I also then learnt formatting of the texts and changing the font style, colors and also centralizing images. Overall, I had a great experience learning all these things and I am
looking forward to learn more cool things!
